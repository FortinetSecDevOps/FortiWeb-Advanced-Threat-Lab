# [ATTACK] ML based Bot detection

In this scenario you will attack an Web Shop Application with an content scraper which can be blocked by FortiWeb Bot detection.

- Why is this important?

There are websites that actually do not allow automated web scraping.  This is mainly because, at most times these bots scrape data with the  intention of gaining competitive advantage and drain the server  resources of the website they are scraping from, thus adversely  affecting site performance. 

## Required Tools / Software Packages

- Bot Script from the lab material ([Link](../Python_Scripts/scrape_products.py))

- Python3 installed

## Preparations

1. Install the necessary Python3 Modules:

```bash
python3 -m pip install requests prettytable
```

2. adjust the URL Variable at the top of the script as necessary:

```python3
url = "http://localhost:3000". #adjust the url to your juiceshop URL
column_width = 80
table_width = 250
```

3. Open the Fortinet Juice Shop Page in any Web browser  just to make sure that you are able to reach the page.

## Scrape all the content

For documentation purpose the Documentation will only cover application hosted on localhost port 3000. Please adjust the documentation with the information provided as needed.

1. Execute the Python script and see how the script extract content from the Web shop.

```bash
$ python3 scrape_products.py

scraping data from Webshop... nomnomnom...
scraping data from Webshop... nomnomnom...
scraping data from Webshop... nomnomnom...
scraping data from Webshop... nomnomnom...
...[SNIP]...
```

2. Now move on to the next chapter where you will learn on how to prevent such bot attacks and how to decide if it was a human or not.
